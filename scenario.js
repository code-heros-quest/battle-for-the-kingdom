His volume begins to increase and ${char.assassin.name} does the only logical thing, blows sleeping powder in his face. This doesn’t force him into sleep, as dwarves are very resistant to these types of drugs but he does seem to become much more relaxed and his eyes have a slightly glazed quality. You all usher the little man into a side alley before the guards come to check out the noise. The dwarf seems unable to speak but ${char.wizard.name} talks to him in a coaxing voice and he begins to slowly tell his tale. “I was the kings personal smith. I make very special weapons, because you see not only am I a smith, I am also a mage. My people have long studied the art of working enchantments into metal as we strike it and the king sent to my people asking for the greatest Mage-Smith we could offer. My work is renowned and I was honored to be chosen by my tribe to come to the palace and craft a blade for the king. Only when I arrived did I begin to see the reality of this request. The king did not want to let me do my work. He began demanding certain qualities and powers of the sword. I tried to tell him that it doesn’t work that way. The metal has a spirit of its own and that determines what attributes the metal will hold when it is formed. The king fired me and threw me out of the palace. I have never been so insulted! The man is an infant and I wouldn’t want one of my masterpieces in his hands anyway!” It seems risky to trust a stranger but this dwarf seems convincingly opposed to the king, so you tell him of your quest. He says “The king is very powerful and he surrounds himself with people who encourage his ego and increase his strength. You will have a hard time defeating him but I will gift you the blade he did not want.” The dwarf pulls a wrapped sword off his back that you didn’t notice until now. “This sword holds many attributes. One of which is the power of Invisibility. It makes itself invisible, and when you pull it the bearer and any they touch become invisible as well. The king wishes only to be seen. It’s second attribute is the power of Grace, when holding this blade the fighter will become more agile and fluid. The king did not think this power masculine enough for his sword. It has some other smaller attributes but those are the main two.” You all look upon the blade with awe, never have you seen such a powerful weapon. ${char.wizard.name} says, “Thank you Sir Mage-Smith, you are truly a master at your art and powerful sorcerer. A blade of this majesty will surely turn the tides for us” The dwarf simply nods, hands ${char.assassin.name} the blade and turns to walk away.

You plan to split up about half way to the palace and approach from different directions. You have almost reached the split point when you see a brawny dwarf trudging down the road towards you. He is cursing up a storm and you wonder if maybe you should duck out of the way to avoid him, but no sooner does that thought cross your mind than the little man hails your group. “You there! If you are going to visit that ungrateful worm that calls himself the king give him my kindest regards” this sentiment is followed by a particularly loud bout of flatulence.

Your group exchanges a familiar look that means “be prepared in case this is a trap” and you walk in. A woman behind the bar points you towards a table while loading a serving boy’s tray with pitchers of beer and piling bowls of stew and loaves of crusty bread on a second tray held by a young girl. You realize these must be her children because they all share the same bright red hair. The tavern is busy with workers coming in for an evening meal. Most of the patrons are younger, and look like skilled laborers… probably without families at home to share the meal. Wealthy enough to afford a meal at a tavern, but not well off enough to eat at one of the places frequented by merchants or guards. The small red haired girl arrives at your table and hands you bowls and bread in exchange for 5 coper coins a piece. She tells you that for two more her brother will fill your mugs and then scampers off. The soup is good despite being thin and the bread is hot and delicious.

He warily addresses your group “You look like you’ve traveled a long way. Seems like there is a storm is on the horizon…” ${char.hunter.name} responds “Better a storm than a draught” and the man's face instantly relaxes. Your contact, Halbert, turns out to be the owner of the Horned Animal. He and his wife took it over when her father died and have been doing their best to keep the business going. He tells you that the tavern used to be busy all day long but now with the people growing more poor the only time they have clients is for dinner. His wife’s father was ill and couldn’t afford to get the care he needed despite having worked hard his whole life. Halbert says “We can’t keep letting the king get rich on the backs of the villagers while we starve or die from treatable maladies. Thank you for hearing our need, I want my children to have a chance at a life without suffering”. He leaves you a map of the palace complex including guard stations and servants entrances and wishes you luck.
